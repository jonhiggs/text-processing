# Text Processing

A collection of tools to assist document writing. I've been developing an interest in the [roff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roff_%28software%29) ecosystem and its successors.

## Tools

- [`demarkdown(1)`][demarkdown.1]: print markdown without formatting.
- [`org(1)`][org.1]: print the first and last sentence from each paragraph.
- [`unfold(1)`][unfold.1]: combine lines, reversing the affects of fold.
