# Text Processing

A collection of tools to assist document writing within the [roff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roff_(software)) ecosystem (and its successors).

- [`demarkdown(1)`][demarkdown.1]: print markdown without formatting.
- [`org(1)`][org.1]: print the first and last sentence from each paragraph.
- [`unfold(1)`][unfold.1]: combine lines, reversing the affects of fold.
